Inventory-Management-System
This is a basic Inventory management system, where you know what you have, where it is and how to manage it. It also keep record of all sales done till that point in a separate file.

I've added 5 features per product:
a. Product id
b. Product Name 
c. Price 
d. Mass/Volume of product 
e. Stock Available

You can perform following tasks from this system
a. Add a new product to your inventory
b. Remove a product from your inventory 
c. Update an existing product 
d. List all Peoducts available 
e. Add items to your own item cart
f. List items in your cart 
g. Checkout to buy products
h. View total sales done till that point

You'll also get a customer copy of generated bill which will have all the information regarding your checkout for eg, date, time, day, your name, etc.
There are two text file having record of products in inventory and total sales till that point.
